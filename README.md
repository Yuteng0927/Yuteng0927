Hello, my name is Yuteng Zhang and I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Biochemistry, in [Department of Chemistry](https://uh.edu/nsm/chemistry/) at [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/). My research interests computational and statistical methods to analyze and interpret biological data in order to gain insights and make discoveries in the field of biochemistry.


- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on metal homeostasis and how it correlated with [neurodegenrative diseases](https://academic-oup-com.ezproxy.lib.uh.edu/metallomics/article/14/11/mfac087/6823721) using cellular imaging data, primarily the subcellular compartmental and protein behaviors in response to oxidative stress.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m currently collaboratively working on [cellular data imaging](https://pubs-acs-org.ezproxy.lib.uh.edu/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c01014) by light/fluorescence microscopy.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [deep learning](https://github.com/Yuteng0927/Deep-Learning-Project) and [machine learning](https://github.com/Yuteng0927/Machine-Learning-Project)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about super-resolution single-molecule fluorescence microscopy.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with 3D reconstructed imaging.
