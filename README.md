Hello, my name is Yuteng Zhang and I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Chemistry (Biochemistry division), in [Department of Chemistry](https://uh.edu/nsm/chemistry/) at [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/). My research interests computational and statistical methods to analyze and interpret biological data in order to gain insights and make discoveries in the field of healthcare.


- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working as a data-driven Operations Scientist, utilizing extensive lab inventory datasets for decision-making and cost reduction strategies, as well as implementing data-based supply chain management techniques.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m experienced in [image analysis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1HtyOXYAAAAJ&hl=en) for molecule localization extraction and 2/3D cellular structure reconstructionon by light/fluorescence microscopy.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [deep learning](https://github.com/Yuteng0927/Deep-Learning-Project) and [machine learning](https://github.com/Yuteng0927/Machine-Learning-Project)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about super-resolution single-molecule fluorescence microscopy.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Cloud computing services and 3D reconstructed imaging.
